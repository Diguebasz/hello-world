# hello-world
Practice repository for learning the Github flow.
I'm Niklas, and this is my practice repo for learning Github. I just started my first semester as a game tech & simulation student, I'm very overwhelmed and kinda freaked out, but I'm gonna give it an honest try and do my best. If I drop out because I failed math or something, this still probably won't be the last you'll see of me! One path can close, but there are always others. Let's not give in to despair preemptively though. Here goes nothing!
